# Ubergency - Smart Ambulance & Emergency Booking Platform
## 🚀 Overview
**Ubergency** is a full-stack, real-time emergency ambulance booking platform designed to modernize and streamline emergency medical transportation. Inspired by ride-hailing systems, Ubergency connects users, ambulance drivers, hospitals, and administrators on a single platform, enabling instant and scheduled ambulance bookings, live tracking, hospital bed availability, and real-time communication.
<br>
This project was developed as **Final Year Project (FYP)** and deployed on **Vercel** using a scalable, production-ready architecture.

<br>

## 🚀 Core Objectives
- Reduce emergency response time
- Provide real-time ambulance tracking
- Enable hospitals to manage bed availability
- Support both instant and scheduled ambulance rides
- Maintain role-based dashboards and access control

<br>

## 🚀 System Roles
### 🎯 User
- Book ambulance instantly or schedule for later
- Live map tracking of ambulance
- Ride history & status updates
- Chat with driver in real time
- View nearest hospitals and bed availability
### 🎯 Driver
- Accept / reject ride requests
- Live navigation & ride status
- Ride history and current ride management
- Real-time chat with user
### 🎯 Hospital
- Manage hospital profile
- Update emergency bed availability
- View incoming ride requests
### 🎯 Admin
